# QR app for Frontend Mentor

In this repository we can find the solution of [the QR exercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H/hub/qr-code-component-r1phUuFm5).
We have implemented the style.css file and adjusted the index.html file in order to clone the example page.

The webpage can be seen in this [link](https://melaubets.github.io/FEM-QRCode/).
